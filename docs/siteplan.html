            <h2>Long Form vs. Short Form Content</h2>
            <p>There are two primary types of content on YouTube: long form and short form. Each has its advantages depending on your goals and audience.</p>
            
            <h3>Long Form Content</h3>
            <p>Long-form content typically exceeds 10 minutes and allows you to dive deeper into a subject. It’s perfect for tutorials, vlogs, and detailed reviews. While it requires more time to produce, it can provide more value and connection with your audience.</p>
            
            <h3>Short Form Content</h3>
            <p>Short-form content, such as YouTube Shorts, is under 60 seconds and designed for quick, attention-grabbing moments. It’s ideal for reaching a broader audience, especially those with limited time, and is excellent for viral moments and trends.</p>
